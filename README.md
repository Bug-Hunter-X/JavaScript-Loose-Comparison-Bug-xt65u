# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript caused by the use of loose comparison (==) instead of strict comparison (===). Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a function that uses loose comparison to check for null values.  This comparison can produce unexpected true results, leading to incorrect program flow.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the bug by using strict comparison (===). Strict comparison ensures that both the value and type of the operands match before returning true.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (browser console, Node.js, etc.).
3. Run the functions in both files and observe the different results.
